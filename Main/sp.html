      <p class='d2p' data-aos="fade-up">Hmmmmmmm.... Our first year <3 !! <br />
Ik every year of our relationship is special in its own way abhi tk so lets just see through it once more on the most special day of my life. I m srsly always more excited for this than my birthday.
Sooo our first year....<br />
Ik i was a bohot shy at the start and thnksssss thnksssss thnkssssss sooo soo sooo muchhhh for jheloing ur dumb bee. And i appreciate soo soo much ur efforts in making me comfortable. itnnaaaa comfortablee ki i am almost besharam ab ‚ù§Ô∏è. I still remember the nights i spent with u that yrr, u used to send me picss but most of them mein u used to hide ur face hand see but i was stilll soo happy to seee ur facee. I swear tbse i have realized ki how much your one smile and just a sneek peak of ur face can make me happy. But it was beautifull. I used to call u an angell cuz u blessed my life with ur presence. We were lucky to meet like almost everydayy in skl. That year was special cuz it has got almost all the "first time" experiences of our affection uk, like our first hug, my first forehead kiss to u, ur first smooshie to me, our first smooshiee, first back hugs, first time dropping u home. And do u remember what i did on our first anniversaryy?? Idk i guess from tbhi se i started long paras for u maybee ya fir shayad one or twice i wud hv written too uu. And do u remember the first time i sent u picc and the way u shattered mera confidence (hilarious btw i was srslyy so nervous ki pta ni bc aise hi gndi shakal h aur kaise react kregi pta ni, maybee i was looking darawana hmmmm). And bee did i invent this "bee" thing first yearr meinnn??? (idk u tell me okii). I Love you so much . And srslyy U ARE AN ANGEL NIKE.</p>

      <p class='d3p' data-aos="fade-up">Hmmmmmmm.... Our second year <3 !! <br />
Ik our second year was tough. We both went through a lot. We both came to our breaking point, giving up point, but still we both bounced back. We both seemed to not understand each other so many times. And ofcourse endlesss fightss. The second year showed us tough times, we coudnt even see each other much. But it made us stronger than everr before, it taught us that fights happen but what matters is how fast u bounce back. It told us that there is smth v special between us and that it is worth fighting for. We learnt that we shud hold on to each other no matter what. And that our love is strong enough to survive any number of fights. U see during our fights it was always like the anger n sadness took more control over us but the love was always there. We cherished jitna bhi time we got saath mein and made beautifulll memoriess that still give me butterflies. The prediwali thingy ke smooshies, backhugs, me rainfiring kisses on u. The randomday park mein we planned and met i srsly didnt think ki it wud goo thiss nice ki it wud become mera fav day of life. Uss din roaming arnd with u market mein, holding ur kamar market mein, and then our hugs, smooshies, we making outt, me giving u neck kisses, making u backbend, holding u so tight, everythngg, everyyythingg was justt soo beautifulll n memorable ki it still gives me butterflies. Our smooshies are the besttt!! We talked so much. We became so comfortable. So comfortable ki i can even compliment ur butt nowww. And ik we couldnt meet so we kept fantacising abt us (me more in this) but it wudnt be possible if u werent cooperative and so comfortable with me, u made me believe everytime ki u r comfortable with me and that i can share any fantasy of mine with u <3. And all i feel is that i have neverr everrr felt like thiss for anyone or neither will i in the future. And alsoo i didnt kharab your birthdayyy this time, i did what i cud to make u happy :). I Love youuu and this ily feels likee suchhh an understatement rn. I hate it i swear. So incapable to express my feelingss. I wish u kneww ki howwww muchh u fucking meann too mee :|. And alsoo i gave u sooo many knew namess this year even though they make me seem like i am hungry all the time but still those r ur nameess bee and v love ke saath i give them to u. And u need to agree i give the best names to u righttt?. Our second year was hard and not so smooth but we became stronger than we were ever before and we are bcming capable of making strong decisions for both of us and our future. Our love became stronger than ever before. We never gave up on each other. I LOVE YOU SO HARD LIKE NO ONE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

      <p class='d4p' data-aos="fade-up">Hmmmmmmm.... Our third year <3 !! <br />
Ik Ik we r just starting the third year but i want to talk abt this too cuz whyy nott. So bee i guess the third year is going to be a bit diff for us like we will have to face new challenges i guess. We both have a goal. And uk we have to get bohot srs n stuff. We have even started the not talking thingy iss mahine. But i guess its going to be tough. I m just scared of just one thingy iss saal mein. I dont want u to feel ki i dont love u, i dont care about u, i am not there when u need me, i dont like talking to u and stuff like thiss bee cuz uk wwe are going to start that no talking thingy and stuff and there r chancess ki u start feeling like this but the reality is bb that aisa kuch bhi ni h bee i only love talking to u spending time with u and i m going to be there when u need me and i love u the most bb i swearr. So if u think aisa kuchh bhii bee just read this and trusttt mee its not like that if there is smone whoo wants u n needs u and loves u from all of his heart so hardd and he loves u the most then itss onlyyy mee nikeee i swearrr. And nike i swear i swear whatever -ve thing u feel is not true i can gurantee u. U r the best and i will love u always n forever no matter what happens!! <3.</p>

      <p class='d5p' data-aos="fade-up">Hmmmmmmm....Us <3 !! <br />
US. The most beautiful thing to me. Ik i m not perfect bee. I make a lot of mistakes. But i assure u n i promise u that no one will ever love u thiss muchh nike. The most precious thing to me is US n U nike. And i wont ever give up on both of them! Even though we fought a lot but u made my days a lot better bee. I feel like we are kinda special nike ngl. Chaahe jitna bhi we fight we both dont seem to give up *touchwood* end mein we are always together *touchwood*. Its smth vv special uk when we both are together. Just thinking of us being together makes me feel butterflies in my stomach. And yes i do want u to become itna comfy with me like u r with urself. And ik its going to take time which is right and it shud be like that but the long time doesnt scare me cuz my plans r big with u which might take more time uk. And i dont want to mention the plans utna to i will stay shhh and u too. Butt... its just a vv diff n special feeling with u. Its like i dont feel connected to anyone aise. i dont even feel a connection with other ppl. But with u its like a vvvvv strong connection. I feel everyth is kinda beautiful b/w us (the fight does make the time a bit ugly butt.. when we meett.. is just completely opposite). Our hugs, our kisses, our touch... Just so special n beautiful.. I m just soo love with uss and so addicted to us being US. I want us to be as strong as graphene("strongest materials known to humans." just googled it :) ). I hope we hold on to each other and i hope we can complete our fantacies soon "smday". The situations we face are hard. And maybe hmare fight mein less patience to jhelo each other is maybee bcuz of not being able to meet zyaada din. But still i am proud of us. I love you the most n the hardest. I love us themost n the hardest.<br /> Be mine forever ‚ù§Ô∏è cuz i cant afford to loose you.</p>
